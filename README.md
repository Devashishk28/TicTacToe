HEY connections!
I have recently created a simple TicTacToe game using java.
This game is designed for two players and runs in the console.
This game is made using java concepts like loops,arrays,conditionals and user input handling using scanner class.
player need to enter his/her input by providing exact row and column no.
This project helped me to strengthen my programming skills.
